# project-SIMON
Have two empty arrays one for the player and one for the pattern i have to repeat 
Have an array of the colors
Once i press start maybe make a function that can add a bunch of colors randomized into the array that Simmon repeats 
For user input when i repeat what simon ust did i can make a function checking if the arrays for level(x) match
create a funtion that can check after 
Somehow make something that can have the full array but only iterate through to the level you reach ( phil says look into game state ) 
ex:
playerArr = [blue, yellow, blue]
simonArr = [[blue, yellow, blue], green, red, yellow]

Level 3 
simonArr === playerArr ????

For every level you pass I have to make a function that'll add 1 point to your score
